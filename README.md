This code is implementing a brute-force algorithm for finding the size of the largest clique in a Hamming graph by using C++ programming language.
The algorithm works by first generating all possible binary vectors of the given length, then constructing the Hamming graph by connecting the vertices that satisfy the minimum distance requirement, and then using a recursive function to search for the largest clique in the graph by adding vertices to the clique one at a time and checking if they are connected to all the other vertices in the clique. The function keeps track of the largest clique found so far and returns it at the end.
The code first reads in the values of n and d from the input, which specify the length of the binary vectors and the minimum distance between connected vertices in the Hamming graph, respectively. It then generates all possible binary vectors of length n, and stores them in the binary_vectors vector. Next, the code constructs the Hamming graph by iterating over all pairs of binary vectors in the binary_vectors vector, and adding an edge between the two vertices corresponding to the vectors if their Hamming distance is greater than or equal to d. The adjacency matrix of the graph is stored in the adj array. After the Hamming graph has been constructed, the code finds the maximal clique in the graph by using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The find_max_clique function is called with the starting index idx set to 0. For each vertex v starting from idx, the function checks if the vertex can be added to the current clique by checking if it is connected to all vertices in the current clique. If it can be added, the function adds it to the clique, and recursively calls itself with the starting index set to v + 1. If the function returns, it removes the vertex from the clique and continues with the next vertex. This process continues until all vertices have been considered. Once the search is complete, the code prints the size of the maximal clique found, which is stored in the best_clique vector.
